                  A Front-End Developer is someone who creates websites and web
                  applications. The difference between Front-End and Back-End is that
                  Front-End refers to how a web page looks, while back-end refers to how
                  it works. You can think of Front-End as client-side and Back-End as
                  server-side. The basic languages for Front-End Development are HTML,
                  CSS, and JavaScript.

                  Back-end development means working on server-side software, which
                  focuses on everything you can't see on a website. Back-end developers
                  ensure the website performs correctly, focusing on databases, back-end
                  logic, application programming interface (APIs), architecture, and
                  servers. They use code that helps browsers communicate with databases,
                  store, understand, and delete data. On a team, back-end developers
                  collaborate with front-end developers, product managers, principal
                  architects, and website testers to build the structure of a website or
                  mobile app. Back-end developers must be familiar with many kinds of
                  tools and frameworks, including languages such as Python, Java, and
                  Ruby. They make sure the back-end performs quickly and responsively to
                  front-end user requests.

                  Web development refers to the creating, building, and maintaining of
                  websites. It includes aspects such as web design, web publishing, web
                  programming, and database management. It is the creation of an
                  application that works over the internet i.e. websites.
